ROBORALLY README
----------------------
**This version of RoboRally is very much still a WIP.**

-----------------------------------------------------
Because of this we recommend cloning the repo from the GitHub repo or entering the version
uploaded in this zip and opening it using an IDE like IntelliJ, and running it from there;
instead of building a fully fledged runnable jar and so forth.

The function that needs to be run to properly run the game is:
src/main/java/dk/dtu/compute/se/pisd/roborally/StartRoboRally.java

For this development JDK18 has been used, and the software
has not been tested using any other version.

This version can now save games when exiting, as well as loading previously saved boards.

The game also includes programming, a timer, different card decks, walls, conveyor belts,
and an upgrade shop (which so far is just an empty window).

There is also an antenna thing to determine player priority as well as holes in the map and that kind of thing.

 

*Bugs and lack of features are to be expected*
