**README**

This version of RoboRally is very much still a WIP.
Because of this we recommend cloning the repo from the GitHub repo or entering the version
uploaded in this zip and running it using an IDE like IntelliJ, instead of building a fully fleged 
runnable jar and so forth.

For this development JDK18 has been used, and the software
has not been tested using any other version.

This version can now save games when exiting, as well as loading previously saved boards.
